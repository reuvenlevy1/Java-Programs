Takes String input from user and file using BufferedReader and reverses it.

This is done in 3 different ways:
  1. Using StringBuffer and appending the characters with substring method
  2. Using String concatenation with substring method
  3. Using String concatenation with charAt method to get last letter added with substring method for other letters recursively
